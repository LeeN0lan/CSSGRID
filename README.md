# CSSGRID
Series of code snippets documenting what I have learnt by completing a course by Wes Bos on CSS Grid. 

This free course aims to take users already proficient with other CSS techniques from no knowledge of CSS grid to an intermediate
knowledge of CSS grid. 

Personally, I think that this is one of the best CSS grid resources out there, and by completing this course, I feel confident in 
using CSS grid, Mozilla grid dev tools, and can confidently explain how to use CSS grid to others (& in a job interview!) .

Gret job Wes, and like his other courses, a really good teaching style and he seems like a genuinely nice guy.
